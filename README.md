# Pomodoro Timer

Pomodoro is a time management method based on 25-minute stretches of focused work broken by five-minute breaks.

This is build using HTML CSS and JavaScript.

## What I learned
I learned about a JavaScript built-in function called `.padStart()`  that helps to make sure that numbers and strings have the same length, by adding extra characters to the beginning of a string.

Before using .padStart(), you will have to make sure that you have the numbers to string.
